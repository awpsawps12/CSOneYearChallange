> Do not worry about the "How" (Implementation) only about the "What" (Abstraction)

Good modular design implies that you can work on the individual modules
independently, while completely ignoring the rest of the system.

Multiple layers of abstraction, each layer is built based on interface
(API) of the previous layer without worrying about its implementation.

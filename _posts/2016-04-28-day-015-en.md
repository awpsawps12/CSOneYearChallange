Today's goals are,

- Be able to use the How to Design Function (HtDF) recipe to design function that operate on primitive data
- Be able to read a complete function design and identify its different elements
- Be able to evaluate the different elements for clarity, simplicity and consistency with each other
- Be able to evaluate the entire design for how well it solves the given problem

Today's goals are,

- Be able to use the How to Design Function (HtDF) recipe to design function that operate on primitive data
- Be able to read a complete function design and identify its different elements
- Be able to evaluate the different elements for clarity, simplicity and consistency with each other
- Be able to evaluate the entire design for how well it solves the given problem


**How to design function recipe?** (HtDF)

This is a structured process, but it's not a locked-in waterfall process. There is some flexibility in following the steps of the process.

There are 5 steps in this recipe,

1. Signature, purpose, stub
1. Examples (wrapped in check-expect)
1. Inventory - template & constants
1. Code body
1. Test and debug

```lisp
;; Number -> Number (Step 1 - Signature)
;; produce 2 times the given number (Step 1 - Purpose)

(check-expect (double 3) 6)      ;; (Step 2 - Examples)
(check-expect (double 5.0) 10.0) ;; (Step 2 - Examples)

(define (double n) 0)       ;; This is a stub (Step 1- Stub)

;; (define (double n)       ;; (Step 3 - Template)
;;  (... n))
  
(define (double n)          ;; (Step 4 - Code Body)
  (* 2 n))
```

Step 1 - Signature, Purpose, Stub (Mock Implementation):

- To form a signature, `Type ... -> Type` which decleares type of data function consumes and produces. Use most specific types that are correct (For now primitive types in BSL are Number, Integer, Natural, String, Image, Boolean)
- Purpose is a `1` line description of what the function produces in terms of what it consumes and it should tell more information compare to the signature (Signature helps)
- Stub is a function definition that has correct function name, correct number of parameters and produces dummy result of correct type. It helps to write the `check-expects`. It serve as a kind of scaffolding to make it possible to run the examples even before the function design is complete (Signature helps)

Step 2 - Examples/Test (Signature helps):

- Examples help us understand what function must do
- Multiple examples to illustrate hebavior
- Wrapping in check-expect means they will also serve as unit test for the completed function

Step 3 - Template (Inventory):

- The body of the template is the outline of the function
- `(... x)` where x is the parameter to the function

Step 4 - Code Body:

- Use everything written before to know who to complete the function body
- Sometimes helps to elaborate examples to show how the expected value could have been produced

Step 5 - Test and Debug

When there is a test failes (Check the test before fix the function body). It could be,

- wrong function definition
- wrong test
- both are wrong


> Design is the process of going from a poorly formed problem to a well structured solution.

**Test Coverage** ([Code Coverage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage)) says given all my tests how much of the code is actually being evalutaed.

At a minimum, the tests should have completed cove coverage. After all the tests are run there should be no unexecuted code.

When doing testing, think about a new case or a new subtlety part way through the design is common. When it happens,

- write an example test right away
- update all affected parts of design, often this involves purpose and/or function definition
- it somtimes involves existing tests or even the signature

```lisp
(if ANYTHING
    true
	false)
	
;; Equivalent to

ANYTHING
```

The designing programs goals are,

1. Return the correct answer on all legal inputs (Most important)
2. Performs the computation efficiency (Sometime critical, always valuable to understand and optimize)

Computational complexity related to two things (1) how much time will it take a program to run and (2) how much memory will it need to run. It is also important to balance to computational complexity and conceptual complexity.

**Computational Complexity**

*Measure complexity* (How long will program take to run?) The answer depends on,

- Machine speed (Measuring time in term of number of basic steps executed)
- Specifics code implementation (See method above)
- Input value (Measuring in term of input size)

Use [Random Access Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_machine) (RAM) as computation model to measure basic steps,

- Steps are executed sequentially
- Step is an operation that takes constant time (assignment, comparison, arithmetic operation, accessing object in memory)

Different input will result different output which affect measuring program complexity. The cases for measuring complexity are ([Best, worst and average case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best,_worst_and_average_case)),

- Best case, minimum running time over all possible input of a give size
- Worst case(our focus, upper bound on running time), maximum running time over all possible input of given size
- Average/Expected case, average running time over all possible inputs of give size

The multiplicative constants are not relevant when comparing algorithms (`5n + 2` is basically as same as `n`), focus on the largest factor in the expression.

A logartithmic algorithm is often almost as good as a constant time algorithm, because the costs grow very slowly.

```
Constant > Log > Linear > Log-linear > Quadratic > Exponential
```

**Using Inheritance** (Using `People` sample)

```
Person
+ name
+ birthday
- GetLastName
- SortByLastName
- GetAge
```

```python
import datetime

class Person(object):
  def __init__(self, name):
    """create a person called name"""
    self.name = name
    self.birthday = None
    self.lastName = name.split(' ')[-1]

  def getLastName(self):
    """return self's last name"""
    return self.lastName

  def setBirthday(self, month, day, year):
    """sets self's birthday to birthDay"""
    self.birthday = datetime.date(year, month, day)

  def getAge(self):
    """returns self's current age in days"""
    if self.birthday == None:
      raise ValueError
    return (datetime.date.today() - self.birthday.days)

  def __str__(self):
    """return self's name"""
    return self.name

  def __lt__(self, other):
    """return True if self's name is lexicographically
    less than other's name and False otherwise"""
    if self.lastName == other.lastName:
      return self.name < other.name
    return self.lastName < other.lastName
```

Python use [timsort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timsort) for sorting sequences, a combination of merge and insertion sorts with good average case performance. All it needs is a "less than" comparison between two objects.

Python interpreter translate `obj1 < obj2` into a method `obj1.__lt__(obj2)`, therefore, to enable sort operations on instances of a class, implement the `__lt__` special method (See code block above).

**Building Class Upon Existing Class** (`MITPerson` Sample)

```
MITPerson
+ id_number
- GetIDNumber
- SortByIDNumber
```

Class variable/attribute belong to a class and shared among all instance from that class.

More about class method and static method can be found at [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12179271/python-classmethod-and-staticmethod-for-beginner).

```python
class MITPerson(Person):
  nextIDNum = 0 # next ID number to assign (Class Variable)

  def __init__(self, name):
    # Initialize Person attriubtes
    Person.__init__(self, name)
    self.idNum = MITPerson.nextIDNum
    MITPerson.nextIDNum += 1

  def getIDNumber(self):
    return self.idNum

  def __lt__(self, other):
    return self.idNum < other.idNum;
```

**More Class** (`Student` Sample)

```
Student
+ type
```

```python
class UG(MITPerson):
  def __init__(self, name, classYear):
    MITPerson.__init__(self, name)
    self.year = classYear

  def getClass(self):
    return self.year

class Grad(MITPerson):
  pass

def isStudent(id):
  return isinstance(obj, UG) or isinstance(obj, Grad)
```

More about Python `pass` can be found at [here](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/controlflow.html#pass-statements).

> **Substitution Principle**, important behaviors of superclass should be supported by all subclasses.

Improved version of the above code block,

```python
class Student(MITPerson):
  pass


class UG(Student):
  def __init__(self, name, classYear):
    MITPerson.__init__(self, name)
    self.year = classYear

  def getClass(self):
    return self.year

class Grad(Student):
  pass

class TransferStudent(Student):
  pass

def isStudent(obj):
  return isinstance(obj, Student)
```

Hierarchy is a really nice way of building abstraction. Create a class in the hierarchy that captures common behaviors of subclasses allows developer to concentrate methods in a single place, and lets developers think about subclasses as a coherent whole ï¼ˆconcentrate things in a single place.

**Using Class** (`Gradebook` Example)

A class includes instances of other classes within it.

```python
class Grades(object):
  """a mapping from students to a list of grades"""
  def __init__(self):
    """create empty grade book"""
    self.students = [] # list of Student object
    self.grades = {} # maps idNum -> list of grades
    self.isSorted = True # true if self.students is sorted

  def addStudent(self, student):
    """Assumes: student is of type Student
    Add student to the grade book"""
    if student in (self.students) :
      raise ValueError("Duplicate student")
    self.students.append(student)
    self.grades[student.getIDNumber()] = []
    self.isSorted = False

  def addGrade(self, student, grade):
    """Assume: grade is a float
    Add grade to the list of grades for student"""
    try:
      self.grades[student.getIDNumber()].append(grade)
    except:
      raise ValueError('Student not in grade book')

  def getGrade(self, student):
    """Return a list of grades for student"""
    try:
      # Get grades for student and make a copy of it
      return self.grades[student.getIDNumber()][:]
    except:
      raise ValueError('Student not in grade book')

  def allStudents(self):
    """Return a list of students in the grade book"""
    if not self.isSorted:
      self.students.sorted()
      self.isSorted = True
    # return copy of list of students
    return self.students[:]
```

Here is an example of using `Gradebook` without knowing the internal details.

```python
def gradeReport(course):
  """Assumes: course if of type grades"""
  report = []
  for s in course.allStudents():
    tot = 0.0
    numGrades = 0
    for g in course.getGrade(s):
      tot += g
      numGrades += 1
    try:
      average = tot/numGrades
      report.append(str(s) + '\'s mean grade is ' + str(average))
    except ZeroDivisionError:
      report.append(str(s) + ' has no grades')
  return '\n'.join(report)
```

Keep in mind that always avoid to access/modify the internal representation directly using method instead.

Python Generator, it is any procedure/method with a `yield` statement. Generators have a `next()` method which starts/resumes execution of the procedure. It then

1. Executing code until next `yield` suspends execution and returns a value
2. When there is no more `yield`; Returning from a generator raises a `StopIteration` exception

Generator separates the concept of computing a very long sequence of object from the actual process of computing them explicitly, which allows one to generate each new objects as needed as part of another computation (rather than computing a very long sequence, only to throw most of it aways while you do something on an element, then repeating the process).

[Here](eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoyNjI0LCJleHAiOjE0NjM5OTk1MDcsInRva2VuX3R5cGUiOiJhcGkifQ.KaGHZS0jXI8ivEWPlMrklpHpcw7YhcmTMRl3v68sUAk) is a discussion about understanding generator.

```python
def genSample():
  yield 1
  yield 2

# Get generator instance
generatorInstance = genSample()
# Use generator
generatorInstance.next()
```

```
genTest() # -> <generator object genTest at 0x201b 878>
```

Using generator example below (using generator to generate Fibonacci number),

```python
def genFib():
  fibn_1 = 1
  fibn_2 = 0

  while True:
    # fib(n) = fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
    next = fibn_1 + fibn_2
    yield next
    fibn_2 = fibn_1
    fibn_1 = next
```

Get next Fibonacci number,

```python
fib = genFib()
fib.next() # -> 1
fib.next() # -> 2
```

Print all Fibonacci numbers in a row,

```python
for n in genFib():
  print n
```

Another generator example apply on `Student`,


```python
def allStudents(self):
  if not self.isSorted:
    self.students.sort()
    self.isSorted = True
  for s in self.students:
    yield s
```

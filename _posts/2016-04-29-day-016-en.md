The goals are,

- Be able to use the How to design data definitions (HtDD) recips to design data definitions for atomic data
- Be able to identify problem domin information that should be represented as simple atomic data, intervlas, enumerations, itemizations and mixed data itemizations
- Be able to use the data driven templates recipe to generate templates for functions operating on atomic data
- Be able to use the How to design function (HtDF) recipe to design functions operating on atomic data

> Data design is a cretial part of program design.

Systems tend to have more function design than data design, but the data design drive the design of the function.


Introducing `cond`, it is a multi-armed conditional. It can have any number of cases all at the same level, kind like `if-else` statement in other programming languages.

To form `cond` expression,

```lisp
(cond [<expression_question> <expression_answer>]
      ...) ;; One more more question answer pairs
```

For each question must evaluate to a boolean and the last question can be `else`.

Code snippets below are equivalent,

```lisp
(define (aspect-ratio img)
  (if (> (image-height image) (image-width image))
      "tall"
	  (if (= (image-height image) (image-width image))
	      "square"
		  "wide")))
```

```lisp
;; (define (function_name parameter)
;;   (cond [Q A]
;;         [Q A]
;; 		   [Q A]))

(define (aspect-ratio img)
  (cond [(> (image-height image) (image-width image)) "tall"]
        [(= (image-height image) (image-width image)) "square"]
		[else "wide"]))
```

In BSL, `()` and `[]` are both equivalent, but by convention we use `[]` around question/answer pairs in `cond` which make `cond` easier to read.

The special case called `else`, if non of the previous questions were true, do this.

To evaluate a `cond` expression,

1. If there are no question/answer pairs. singal an error
1. If the first question is not a value, evalute it and replace it with its value. Replace the entire cond with a new `cond` in which the first question has been replaced by its value
1. If the first question is true/else, replace the entire `cond` expression with the first answer
1. If the first question is false drop the first question/answer pair, Replace the `cond` with a new `cond` that does not have the first question/answer pair
1. Since the first question is not, true/false, signal an error

And once again steps below are for evaluate primitive call,

1. First reduce operands to values (called the arguments)
1. Then apply primitive to the values

Here are rules for function calls, `if` and `cond` all work by trying to reduce program to a simpler program that does not have that construct,

- Function call is replaced with body
- `if` is replaced with true/false question
- `cond` is replaced with one answer


In each program, we represent information in the problem domain (Real life problem) using data in the program.


**Data Definition**, describe how developers are representing information as data. (Code snippet below is one sample data definition)

- How to form data of a new type
- How to represent information as data
- How to interpret data as information
- Tempalte for operating on data

Moreover, data definition simplifies function by,

- Restricts data consumed
- Restricts data produced
- Helps generate examples
- Provides tempalte

```lisp
;; Data Definition
;; TLColor is one of:
;; - 0
;; - 1
;; - 2
;; interp. color of traffic light - 0 is red, 1 is yellow, 2 is green

(define (fn-for-tlcolor c)
  (cond [(= c 0) (...)]
        [(= c 1) (...)]
	    [(= c 2) (...)]))
```

`interp.` is interpertation which expplains how to interpret data of this type as infromation htereby establishing the information/data correspondence.

Code at bottom is the template skeleton for one-argument functions that consume data of this type `TLColor`. The template for a function is determined by the type of data it consumes.

Example of designing data definition accompanying Data Driven-Template recipe (HtDD),

The problem is to design a data which contains infromation about the name of cities.

Different type of data should use a data fefinition of different kind, for example, atomic (This information cannot be taken apart into pieces that are meaningfully part of the same problem domain) information should use Simple Atomic Data.

A data definition consistes of four/five parts,

1. A possible structure definition
1. A type comment that defines a new type name and describes how to form data
1. An interpretation that describes the coorespondence between inroamtion and  data
1. One or more examples of the data
1. A template for a 1 arugment function operating on data of this type

At the first of using (HtDD) you may also include a list of tempalte rule used to form the template

```lisp
; Information  Data
; Venocurver   "Venocurver"
; Singapore    "Singapore"
```

Everything above should be well captured inside the Data Definition below,

```lisp
;; CityName is String
;; interp. the name of city
(define CN1 "Boston")
(define CN2 "Vancouver")

(define (fn-for-city-name cn)
  (... cn))

;; Template rule used:
;;  - atomic non-distinct: String
```

**How to design a function that consume a data defined using HtDD recipe**

Problem is to use the CityName data definition below design a function that produces true if the given city is the best in the world.

For function produce boolean value, it needs at least one test that produces true and one that produces false.

```lisp
;; CityName -> Boolean
;; Produce true if the given city is the best in the world otherwise produce false

(check-expect (best? "Singapore") false)
(check-expect (best? "Beijing") true)

;; (define (best? cn) false) ; stub

;; Took template from CityName
(define (best? cn)
  (... cn))
  
(define (best? cn)
  (if (string?= cn "Beijing")
      true
	  false)
```

Important thing about the template, it whos what you *can* use, not what you *must* use; You will sometimes delete parts of templates.

> You always know what to do next when you working with a systematic design process.


The function recipe and data recipe are orthogonal (statistically independent). The recipes are going to work unchanged or mostly unchanged with many other forms of data.

**HtDD - Interval**

Problem is to represent a set number in a row where each row has 32 seats (Just the seat number not row number)

```lisp
;; SeatNum is Natural[1, 32]
;; interp. seat numbers in a row, 1 and 32 are aisle seats
(define SN1 1)  ; aisle
(define SN2 12) ; middle
(define SN3 32) ; aisle

(define (fn-for-seat-num sn)
  (... sn)
)

;; Template rules used:
;; - atomic non-distinct: Natural[1, 32]

```

`[]` breakets means inclusive at the end of the interval, and `()` brackets means exclusive. Natural is ingeters starting at `0` and Number includes all real numbers.


**HtDD - Enumeration**

Problem is to design a data definition to represetn the letter grade in a course which is one of A, B, C.

```lisp
;; LetterGrade is one of:
;; - "A"
;; - "B"
;; - "C"
;; interp. the latter grade in a course

```

For enumerations, especially those with strings as data, the interpretations tend to be straightforward.

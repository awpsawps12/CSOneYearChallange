**Key Concepts**

- Boolean Algebra
- Boolean Functions
- Gate Logic
- Elementary Logic Gates
- Hardware Describe Language (HDL)
- Hardware Simulation

Boolean algebra deals with Boolean. Truth Table Representation of the Function -\> enumerate all possible values `2**n` of possible tuples.

Canonical Representation, each boolean function can be expressed using
at least one boolean expression.

Few common *Laws* ([Boolean
Identity](https://web.cs.dal.ca/~grundke/reference/boole.html)) are (Can
be proved using *Truth Table*),

-   Commutative Laws
-   `(x AND y) ` (y AND x)=
-   `(x OR y) ` (y OR x)=
-   Associative Laws
-   `(x AND (y AND z)) ` ((x AND y) AND z)=
-   `(x OR (y OR z)) ` ((x OR y) OR z)=
-   Distributive Laws
-   `(x AND (y OR z)) ` (x AND y) OR (x AND z)=
-   `(x OR (y AND z)) ` (x OR y) AND (x OR z)=
-   Double Negation Lows
-   `NOT(NOT(x)) ` x=
-   [De Morgan Laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Morgan%27s_laws)
-   `NOT(x AND y) ` NOT(x) OR NOT(y)=
-   `NOT(x OR y) ` NOT(x) AND NOT(y)=
-   [Idempotence Laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence)
-   `x AND x ` x=

The Boolean Function can be represented using *Boolean Expression* and
*Truth Table* (Identical Definition of the same Boolean Function). The
Boolean Function can be simplified using *laws* or using *truth table*
(sometime it is NOT easy to do).

The real task when working with a computer is to convert from *Truth
Table* into *Boolean Expression* which is constructing a [Disjunctive
Normal Form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjunctive_normal_form)
Formula.

**Truth Table Conversion To Boolean Expression**

1.  Focus ONLY on expression that gets a value of `1`
2.  Get the boolean expression gets value `1` for that specific row ONLY
3.  Using `OR` to chain the boolean expressions
4.  Simplify the boolean expression using Laws mentioned above

However, the shortest and most efficient formula that's equivalent to
the target boolean expression usually is extreme hard to find/verify (It
is a [NP-hard Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-hardness)).

1.  The theorem is that any boolean function can be represented using an
    expression containing `AND`, `OR` and `NOT` operations. (Any boolean
    function can be presented using truth table representation)

2.  The theorem is that any boolean function can be represented using an
    expression containing `AND` and `NOT` operations (`OR` can be
    represented using `(x OR y) ` NOT(NOT(x) AND NOT(y))=).

3.  The theorem is that any boolean function can be represetned using an
    expression containing only `NAND` operations. (`NOT` can be
    represented using `NOT(x) ` (x NAND x)= and `AND` can be represented
    using `(x AND y) ` NOT(x NAND y)=)

`NAND` Operation, `(x NAND y) ` is equal to `NOT(x AND y)`. **Nand**, is the basic logical gate.

```
  x   y   NAND
  --- --- ------
  0   0   1
  0   1   1
  1   0   1
  1   1   0
```

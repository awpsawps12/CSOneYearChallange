Testing methods are ways of trying code on examples to determine if running correctly. Debugging methods are ways of fixing a program.

The code should be designed for ease of testing and debugging at first place by breaking program into components (functions/classes) that can be easily tested and debugged independently. Document constraints on modules and assumptions behind code design.

**Before test**,

- Ensure code runs (No syntax errors; No static semantic errors;)
- Have a set of expected results ready

**Prepare test**, the goal is to show that bugs exist (It is hard to prove that a code is bug free).

*Test Suite*, is a collection of inputs that has high likelihood of revealing bugs. (Impossible to check every single case; Formal methods help, but only applicable on simpler code)

A *partition* of a set divides that set into a collection of subsets such that each element of the original set belongs to one of the subset. So it is reasonable to expose a bug if one exists.

Blow are some sample partition for function `isBigger(x, y)`,

- `x` positive, `y` positive
- `x` negative, `y` negative
- `x` positive, `y` negative
- `x` negative, 'y' positive
- `x = 0`, `y = 0`
- `x = 0`, `y != 0`
- `x !=0`, `y = 0`

Where there is no natural partition to input space, use the test methods below,

- [*Random Testing*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_testing), probability that code is correct increases with number of trials
- [*Black-box Testing*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-box_testing), use heuristics based on exploring paths through the specification (Can be done by anyone; Avoid inherent biases; Reusable test)
- [*Glass-box Testing*/*White-box Testing*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-box_testing), use heuristics based on exploring paths through the code (all test suite should be *path-complete*, every potential path through the code)
  - Make sure all conditional (`if`) statements are checked
  - Ensure each `except` clause is executed
  - Ensure each loop have test where (loop is no entered; loop execute once and more than once)
  - Recursive function (no recursive call and more than one recursive call)

**Conduct test**,

- Unit testing, check each module and catch algorithm bugs
- Integration testing, check the system as a whole and catch interaction bugs
- Cycle between phases

Highly Automated Testing environment using,

- Test Drivers, set up environment needed to run code; run test suites; save results; report
- Stubs, simulate parts of program used by unit being tested (For example, Mock server or simulation of unimplemented functionality)

**Good Testing Practice**

- Start with unit testing
- Move to integration testing
- [Regression testing](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3464629/what-does-regression-test-mean) after code is corrected (Check the program still passes all the tests)

> Debugging is an art.

The [first bug](http://thenextweb.com/shareables/2013/09/18/the-very-first-computer-bug/) was found at Harvard on the [Mark II]().

(Seriously???)

Information of bugs,

- Runtime bugs, occur during running of code
  - Overt, has an obvious manifestation (crashes/runs forever)
  - Covert, has no obvious manifestation (return values which may not correct)
  - Persistent, occurs every time code is runs
  - Intermittent, only occurs sometimes (even on save input)

Categories of bugs,

- Overt and persistent
  - Obvious to detect
  - Avoid by using *defensive programming* (bug fall into this category)
- Overt and intermittent
  - Hard to debug
- Covert  
  - Highly dangerous

[*Defensive Programming*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_programming), programming mistakes lead to bugs that are both overt and persistent.

**Debugging Skills** (Debugging as Search)

Debugging(Transferable skill) is the searching process for an explanation of certain behavior. The key to being good at debugging is being systematic in conducting search.

- Study available data (both correct/incorrect test cases)
- Form an hypothesis that consistent with the data
- Design and run a repeatable experiment with potential to refute the hypothesis
- Keep record of experiments performed, use narrow range of hypotheses

*Bisection search* is a powerful method to narrowing down the buggy area (Debugging as search, think about the code as a list, start from the middle of the code).

**Debugging Hints** (7)

- Look for the usual suspects
- Ask why the code is doing what it is, NOT why it is not doing what you want
- The bug is probably not where your think it is (eliminate locations)
- Explain the problem to someone else
- Do NOT believe everything you read (the documentation)
- Stop debugging and start writing doc. which help you approach the problem from a different perspective
- Take a break and come back to the bug later

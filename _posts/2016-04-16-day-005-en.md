Looping constructs (`while` or `for`) leads to [iterative algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_method).

**Recursion Algorithm** is important. It reduces a problem into a simple version of the same problem which can be solved directly. It made up of two parts,

- at least one base case
- at least one recursive (inductive) case

Each recursive call (function call) to a function creates its own environment. Binding for variable in each frame (environment) distinct. Flow of control will pass back to earlier frame once function call returns value.

```python
# multiplication
def recurMul(a, b):
  if b == 1:
    return a
  else:
    return a + recurMul(a, b - 1)

# find factorial num using recursion
def factR(n):
  """Assumes that n is an int > 0
     Return n!"""
    if n == 1:
      return n
    else:
      return n * factR(n - 1)
```

> - Then prove that if it is true for an arbitrary value of `n`, one can show that it must be true for `n + 1`

[**Divide and Conquer Algorithm**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide_and_conquer_algorithms) is based on *multi-branched recursion* which solves a hard problem by breaking it into a set of sub-problems such that sub-problems are easier to solve than the original and the solution of the sub-problems can be combined to solve the original problem.

[Global variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_variable) is a variable with global [scope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_(computer_science))(Inside the  program where the name binding is valid) which is dangerous and destroying code locality, therefore, use with caution.

In Python, `global` keyword is to change/create global variable in a local context (See more [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4693120/use-of-global-keyword-in-python)

# Objectives

- Describe algorithmic steps such that computer use them to execute process
- Programming language translates computational ideas into mechanical steps


The differences between languages are,

- Lower-level vs. High-level
- General vs. Targeted to an application domain
- Interpreted vs. Compiled

1. Low level language, instructions similar to internal Control Unit (Move data, simple ALU operation, jump point in sequence based on test)
  - Checker confirm syntax and static semantics correct
  - Interpreter follow the sequences of the instructions
2. High level compiled language
  - Check
  - Compile (Converted back into low level instructions)
  - Interpreter (Executed)
3. High level interpreted language (ex. Python)
  - Check
  - Special program converts source code into internal data structure
  - Interpreter *sequentially* converts each step into low level instruction and executes

Python is a sequence of definitions and commands/statements (instructs interpreter to do things). Definitions evaluated and commands executed by [Python interpreter](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/interpreter.html) in a **shell** (Interactive environment, [Shell (Computing)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing))). The script can be typed or read from a file into a shell and evaluated.

Python Program manipulate data objects, each object has a **type** which defines what can be done to it. There are two types of object,
- Scalar (Primitive Type), indivisible like atoms (below are Python objects)
  - `int`
  - `float`
  - `bool`
  - `None`
- Non-scalar(Compound Object), type with internal structure
  - `string` ([Operation on `string`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html))
  - etc.

```python
type(3)   # -> <type 'int'>
type(3.0) # -> <type 'float'>
```

*Expression* is the combination of objects and operators (Below is a simple expression).

```
<object><operator<object>
```

Common operators are `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**` (power of) and `%` (remainder). Operators are executed from left to right, use `()` to define sub-computations. (Detailed Python Operator precedence can be found [here](https://docs.python.org/2/reference/expressions.html#operator-precedence))

[Comparison operators](https://docs.python.org/2/reference/expressions.html#not-in) (`>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`) and [operators on boolean](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#boolean-operations-and-or-not) (`and`, `or`, `not`) in Python are not discuss here.

Type conversion can be done using name of type as a function.

```python
float(3) # -> 3.0
int(3.9) # -> 3
```

Variable name provides simple abstraction and make the value reusable.

```python
pi = 3.14159
```

Code above assigns (binding name and value stored in computer) the name `pi` to the value of the expression to the right of `=`. The value can be retrieve by invoking the name, `pi` in this case. The variable name can be rebound by invoking new assignments statements.

Use `print` for simple output and `raw_input` for simple input.

Everything after `#` will be ignored by interpreter.

A straight line program executes each statement in order. The simplest branching statement is a conditional (Possible nested conditionals),

- A test ([Comparisons operations](https://docs.python.org/2/reference/expressions.html#not-in))
- A block of code
- An optional block of code

characteristics of Branching programs are,

- Make choices and do different things
- Each statement gets executed once only
- Maximum running time depends on the length of the program
- Running time is *constant*

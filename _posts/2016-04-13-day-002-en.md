TODO: Change Turing Machine and Turing Completeness section

Turing ([*Alan Turing*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing), 1912-1954)  completeness states that anything computable can be computed using computer. (Any thing that can be programmed in one language can be programmed in any other language)

Programming languages define syntax and semantics needed to translate computational ideas into mechanical steps. Interactive with computer always roughly the same.

Languages difference are,

- Lower-level vs. high-level
- General vs. targeted to an application domain
- Interpreted vs. compiled

1. Low level, instructions similar to internal control unit
  - Checker confirm syntax and static semantics correct
  - Interpreter follow the sequences of instructions
2. High level compiled
  - Check
  - Compile all
  - Interpreter
3. High level interpreted
  - Check
  - Converts each steps into low level instruction and executes

Aspects of [Programming Languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language)

- Set of primitive constructs, literals such as number, string, [infix operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infix_notation)
- Syntax (Syntax error)
- Static semantics, whether valid statements have any meaning (Static semantics error, `10/'2'`)
- Semantics, There is [one and only one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniqueness_quantification) meaning associated with one particular statement (Meaning may not be what was intended, which can be prevented by practicing defensive programming)

Objects are the core things Python ([Python Syntax](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python/)) programs manipulate. Object has type which defines things that programs can do that type. There are two types,

- Scalar(primitive type), indivisible like atoms (below are Python objects)
  - `int`
  - `float`
  - `bool`
  - `None`
- Non-scalar(compound objects), type with internal structure
  - `string`
  - etc.

*Expression* is the combination of objects and operators.

The simplest branching statement is a conditional,

- A test ([Comparisons operations](https://docs.python.org/2/reference/expressions.html#not-in))
- A block of code
- An optional block of code

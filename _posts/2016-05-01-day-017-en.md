# Computational Thinking

**What do computer scientists do?**

- They think computationally (Abstractions, algorithms, automated execution)
- Computational thinking will be a fundamental skill used by everyone in the world
- Just like the 3 Rs (Reading, Riting, Rithmetic) Ubiquitous computing and computers will enable the spread of computational thinking as a fundamental skill

**Computational Thinking Process**

- Identify/invent useful abstractions (Suppressing details, formulating interfaces)
- Formulate solution to a problem as a computational experiment using abstractions
- Design and construct a sufficiently efficient implementation of experiment
- Validate experimental setup (Debug)
- Run experiment
- Evaluate results of experiment
- Repeat as needed (Repeat the steps above)

**Three A of Computational Thinking**

- **Abstraction**
  - Choosing the right abstractions
  - Operating in terms of multiple layers of abstraction simultaneously
  - Defining the relationships the between layers
- **Automation**
  - Think in terms of mechanizing abstractions
  - Mechanizations is possible (Precise and exacting notations and models)
- **Algorithms**

[Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)) is a new data structure. A tree,

- consists of one/more nodes (a note has a value associated with it)
- nodes are connected by branches
- a tree starts with a root note, each node has one/more children (Refer not which has a child as the parent node and notes with no further branch are called leaves)
- no child has more than one parent for simple trees (In fact for note has more than one parent is called [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(abstract_data_type)))

The tree on the right is called [binary tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree), a tree data structure with each note has at most two children. It is very useful when storing and searching ordered data, or when determining the best decision to make in solving many classes of problems.

**Binary Tree Class**

```python
class binaryTree(obj):
  def __init__(self, value):
    self.value = value
    self.leftBranch = None
    self.rightBranch = None
    self.parent = None

  def setLeftBranch(self, node):
    self.leftBranch = node

  def setRightBranch(self, node):
    self.rightBranch = node

  def setParent(self, parent):
    self.parent = parent

  def getValue(self):
    return self.value

  def getLeftBranch(self):
    return self.leftBranch

  def getRightBranch(self):
    return self.rightBranch

  def getParent(self):
    return self.parent

  def __str__(self):
    return self.value
```

To search a tree,

- To determine if an element is present
- To find a path to a solution point
- To make a series of decisions to reach some objective

There are two type of search,

- [Depth first search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search)
  1. Start with the root
  2. At any note, if we have not reached objective, take the left branch first
  3. When get to a left, backtrace to the  first decision point and take the right branch
- [Breadth first search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search)
  1. Start with the root
  2. Then proceed to each child at the next level, in order
  3. continue until reach objective

**Depth First Search**

- Keep a data structure ([stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)), a last in first out structure, LIFO) that holds nodes still to be explored
- Use an evaluation function to determine when reach objective
- Start with the root node
- Then add children, if any, to front of data structure, with left branch first
- Continue in this manner

Sample code for *Depth First Search*,

```python
def DFSBinary(root, func):
  stack = [root]

  while len(stack) > 0:
    if func(stack[0]):
      return True
    else:
      temp = stack.pop(0)
      if temp.getRightBranch():
        stack.insert(0, temp.getRightBranch())
      if temp.getLeftBranch():
        stack.insert(0, temp.getLeftBranch())
  return False
```

**Breadth First Search**

```python
def DFSBinary(root, func):
  queue = [root]

  while len(queue) > 0:
    if func(queue[0]):
      return True
    else:
      temp = queue.pop(0)
      if temp.getRightBranch():
        stack.append(temp.getRightBranch())
      if temp.getLeftBranch():
        stack.append(temp.getLeftBranch())
  return False
```

A simple recursion function to traceback the parent of a note,

```python
def TracePath(node):
  if not node.getParent():
    return [node]
  else
  return [node] + TracePath(node.getParent())
```

An [**ordered tree**](http://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/orderedtrees/) means that for any node all the nodes to the "left" are less than that node's value and all the nodes to the right are grater than the node's value.

A decision problem can be nicely captured using a tree ([decision tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree)). A decision tree is special type of binary tree, at each note a decision is mode with a positive decision taking to the **left** branch and a negative decision taking the **right** branch. The goal is satisfied when reach a left and the path back to the root node defines the solution to the problem captured by the tree.

Building a decision tree. One way is to construct an actual tree, then search it OR implicitly build the tree as needed.

Below is an example of using a decision tree to **Knapsack Problem**.

[Knapsack Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem), suppose we are given a set of objects with a value and a weight and the space is finite. We want to store the items that have the most value, subject to the constraint that there is a limit to the cumulative size that will fit.

- At the root level, we decide whether to include the first element (left branch) or not (right branch)
- At the $$n^{th}$$ level, we make the same decision for the $$n^{th}$$ element
- By keeping track of what we have included so far and what we have left to consider, we can generate a binary tree of decisions

```python
def buildDTree(sofar, todo):
  if len(todo) == 0:
    return binaryTree(sofar)
  else:
    withelt = buildDTree(sofar + [todo[0]], todo[1:])
    withoutelt = buildDTree(sofar, todo[1:])
    here = binaryTree(sofar)
    here.setLeftBranch(withelt)
    here.setRightBranch(withoutelt)
    return here
```

Searching a decision tree (Using depth first search),

```python
def DFSDTree(root, valueFunc, constraintFunc):
  stack = [root]
  best = None
  visited = 0

  while len(stack) > 0:
    visited += 1
    if constraintFunc(stack[0].getValue()):
      if best == None:
        best = stack[0]
      elif valueFunc(stack[0].getValue()) > valueFunc(best.getValue()):
        best = stack[0]
      temp = stack[0]
      if temp.getRightBranch():
        stack.insert(0, temp.getRightBranch())
      if temp.getLeftBranch():
        stack.insert(0, temp.getLeftBranch())
      else:
        stack.pop()
    print "visited", visited
    return best
```

**Compound Data Types** (Non-scalar Object), Tuples, Lists and Dictionaries.

- [Tuples](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html#tuples-and-sequences), ordered sequence of elements (any object with no aliasing issue)
  - Immutable (tuple, int, float, str)
  - Concatenation `+`
  - Indexing
  - Slicing
  - Singleton `(3,) # -> (3)` instead of `(3) # -> 3`
- [List](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions) (Array in other languages), ordered sequence of values
  - **Mutable** (Big Difference from Tuple)
  - Singleton `[3]`
  - Cloning `new_array = origin_array[:]`
  - List comprehension `[x**2 for x in range(1,7)]` gives you `[1,4,9,16,25,36]` (Not readable)
  - Deletion `del array[index]`
- [Dictionary](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries), generalization of unordered lists(key can be any immutable value)
  - Mutable
  - Deletion `del dictionary[key]`
  - Key must be immutable

In Python, argument(s) is [passing by assignment](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/programming.html#how-do-i-write-a-function-with-output-parameters-call-by-reference).

- Reference/Mutable Type
  - Reference to an object, `Person` object
  - Data types are mutable, `list` or `dictionary`
- Immutable Type

*Passing Reference* may cause *aliasing bug* (Two distinct paths pointing to the save object).

In Python, **Function** is first class objects (Particular useful to use function as arguments, also known as [higher order programming](http://www.composingprograms.com/pages/16-higher-order-functions.html)),

- it has types `<type 'function'>`
- it can be elements of data structures like lists
- it can appear in expressions (as part of assignment statement/argument to a function)

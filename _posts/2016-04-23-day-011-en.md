Python supports many data types (Scaler and Non-scale)

It is great power to define interface for data object which lead to the idea of objects and object oriented programming.

Object has,

- Type, defines it behavior in Python.
- Internal data representation
- A set of procedures for interaction with the object

There are *two* way to implement a **List** internal data representation,

- `int` length `L`, and object array of size `S >= L` (Easy access)
- A linked list of individual cells `<data, pointer to next cell>` (Easy changing)

> Internal representation is **private** - users of the objects should not rely on particular details of the implementation. Correct behavior may be compromised if you manipulate internal representation directly.

Procedures for manipulate lists can be found at [here](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html) (Associated [methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_(computer_programming)) and using of dot notation).

[**Object-oriented Programming**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) (OOP), a program paradigm.

- Everything is an object and has a type
- Objects are a data abstraction
  - Encapsulate internal representation
  - Encapsulate interface for interacting with object (Define behaviors and hide implementation/data hiding)
- Create instance of objects (Explicitly or using literals, see sample below) and Destroy objects (`del` in Python) make memory available again

```python
a = Int(1)
b = 1
```

> Some languages have support for "data hiding" (access control) which prevents access to private attributes.

**Advantages of Object-oriented Programming**

*Divide-and-conquer* development,

- Implement and test behavior of each class separately (Easy Testing)
- Increased modularity reduces complexity (Easy Build Process)

Class make it easy to *reuse* code,

- Python modules define new class
- Each class has a separate environment (avoiding collision and more about Python class can be found at [here](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/classes.html))

[**Abstraction**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_(software_engineering)) is extremely valuable for Object-oriented Programming.

> The essence of abstractions is preserving information that is relevant in a given context, and forgetting information that is irrelevant in that context.

**Python Class Sample**

Class can inherit [attribute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instance_variable)/instance variable from other class, `SampleClass` is a subclass of `object`, `object` is a superclass of `SampleClass`.

The inherited attributes and methods can be override with a new definition in the class statement.

```python
class SampleClass(object):
  # attributes/instance variable

  # methods
```

Initial value(s) will be provided when creating new instance of an object. Use `__init__` in Python. The code below [override](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_overriding) the `__init__` method in `object` class.

```python
class SampleClass(object):
  def __init__(self, x, y):
    self.x = x
    self.y = y
```

- `self` points to the instance of the object (name does not matter, but always stick to the convention)
- `self.x` access the value of `x` inside the instance (create if not exist and `.` operator is used to access an attribute of an object); When accessing an attribute of an instance, start by looking within class, than move up to superclass(es), the move to the global environment.

**Python Create Instance**

`self` is automatically pass to any method.

```python
a = SampleClass(1, 2)
b = SampleClass(2, 3)
print a.x, b.y # -> 1, 3
```

`SampleClass(1, 2)` create a new object of type classname and call `__init__` with new instance and values as arguments. Python return the initialized object as the value. In this case, assign object instance to variable `a`.

Class definition creates a binding of class name in global environment to a new frame/environment.

This new frame/environment contains any attributes bindings (variables/local procedures)

This new frame also knows the parent environment (Superclass's environment) which it can inherit.

The attribute and procedures can be access using dot notation. Python interprets code below by finding the binding for the first expression (a frame), and then using the standard rules to lookup the value for the next part of the expression in the frame.

```python
ClassName.__init__ # access the init method
```

Override method from super class and define new method,

```python
class ClassName(object):
  def __init__(self, x, y):
    self.x = x
    self.y = y

  # Override __str__ method defined in object
  def __str__(self):
    return "<" + self.x + ", " + self.y + ">"

  # Define new method
  def distance(self, other):
    return math.sqrt(sq(self.x - other.x) + sq(self.y - other.y))
```

Check if an instance of is from particular class (Read more about `isinstance` [here](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#isinstance)),

```python
c = ClassName()
print isinstance(c, ClassName) # -> true
```

**Sample: A Set of Integers**

A new type to represent a set/collection of integers

Behavior,

- Empty initially
- One particular integer appears once in a set (This constraint called a *representational invariant*).

Internal Data Representation,

- Use list to remember the element of a set

Interface,

- `insert(e)`, insert integer `e` into set if not there
- `member(e)`, return boolean value if `e` is in set
- `remove(e)`, remove `e` from set, error is not present

```python
class intSet(object):
  """ An intSet is a set of Integers
  The value is represented by a list of ints, self.vals
  Each int in the set occurs in self.vals exactly once
  """

  def __init__(self):
    """Create an empty set of integers"""
    self.vals = []

  def insert(self, e):
    """Assume a e is an integer and insert e into self.vals"""
    if not e in self.vals:
      self.vals.append(e)

  def remove(self, e):
    """Assume e is an integer and remove e from self
    Raises ValueError is e is not in self"""
    try:
      self.vals.remove(e)
    except:
      raise ValueError(str(e) + ' not found')

  def __str__(self):
    """Returns a string representation of self"""
    self.vals.sort()
    return "[" + ".".join([str(e) for e in self.vals]) + "]"
```

Everything learned so far lacks [abstraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_(computer_science)). Functions provide abstraction, which capture computation and treat as if primitive (Encapsulate computation within a scope).

```
def <function name> (<formal_parameters>):
  <function body>
```

*Function name* is binding to the procedure object in python.

```python
def function_name(formal_parameter0, formal_parameter1):
  return None

# Actual parameter also known as argument
function_name(actual_parameter0, actual_parameter1)
```

What happen when a function get invoked,

1. Bind actual parameter(s) and formal parameter(s)
2. Move *point of execution* to body of function
3. Execute function body until end or `return` (with newly created stack frame/symbol table, this scope called static/lexical scope)
4. Invocation is bound to the returned value (stack frame goes away/popped off the top stack after function completes)
5. Transfer back the *point of execution*

Expressions are evaluated until,

- Run out of expressions, `None` is returned
- Until keyword `return` is reached, subsequent expression is evaluated and that value is returned as value of function call

Environment are formalism for tracking bindings of variables and values. Assignment pair name and value in environment. Asking for value of name looks up in current environment.

What happen when a function get called,

1. Evaluate `<expr0>(<expr1>, .., <exprn>)`
1. Looks up procedure object in environment
1. Evaluate each `<expri>` to get value of parameters
1. Bind parameter names in procedure object to value of arguments in a new frame
1. Evaluate body of procedure relative to the new frame

For parameter binding, Python supports *positional*, *keyword arguments* (used conjunction with default value, see below).

```Python
def function_name(formal_parameter0, formal_parameter1 = DEFAULT_VALUE):
  return None
```

Each function call creates a new environment, which scopes bindings of formal parameters, values and local variables. This scoping often called *static/lexical* scope because [scope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_(computer_science)) within which variable has value is defined by extend of code boundaries.

[**Function Specification**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_specification), a contact between implementer of function and client (users of a function), which states,

- Assumptions, conditions that must be met by users of function (ex. constraints on parameters)
- Guarantees, condition that must be met by function

In order to treat procedures as primitives, it should has two properties,

- **Decomposition**, create structure, break a problem into modules that are self-contained and reusable.
- **Abstraction** (many-to-one process), function provide abstraction (capture computation and treat as if primitive). Internal details are hidden (a.k.a. black box). It preserve relevant information in given context and forget irrelevant information. The **key of abstraction** is to find notion of relevance (The true art of abstraction) which is appropriate for both builder and client.

```python
# object `x` bound to name in function
# it is treated as local to that function
def f(x): # <- `x` is local to `f` function
  def g():
    x = 'abc'
    print 'x:', x
  def h():
    z = x
    print 'z:', z
  x = x + 1
  print 'x:', x
  h()
  g()
  print 'x:', x
  return g

x = 3
z = f(x)
print 'x:', x
print 'z:', z
z()
```

The **Stack Frame** for function above,

**Test function** is important which saves tremendous amount of time while developing.

[*docstring*](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/#specification) provides specifications of functions and can be accessed using the build-in `help`.

```python
# Google Style docstring
def function_with_docstring(arg):
    """function functionality description

    Args:
      arg (str): string argument sample input

    Returns:
      bool: True, False otherwise
    """
    return 1990

def findRoot(x, power, epsilon):
  """Assumes x and epsilon int or float,
    power an int, epsilon > 0 & power >= 1
    Returns float y such that y**power is within epsilon of x.
    If such a float does not exist,
    it returns None"""
  # Your code goes here
```

**Modules in Python**

A *module* is a `*.py` individual file containing Python definitions and statements. Each *module* has its private symbol table (environment). Detail about Python Modules can be found at [here](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/modules.html).

```python
# XYMath.py
pi = 3.141592653
```

Using `import` as a namespace, however, `from XXX import *` works like copy-paste entire `XXX` file on top of the current file.

```python
# app.py
import XYMath
print XYMath.pi # -> 3.141592653
```

```python
# app0.py
from XYMath import *
print pi # -> 3.141592653
```

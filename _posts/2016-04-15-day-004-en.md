[**Bisection Search**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisection_method)(Searching continuous function values)/[**Binary Search**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm)(Searching a finite sorted array), reducing the range in each stage dramatically which means algorithm is important.
<!-- being smart about generating guesses is imporatnt for guess and check method.-->

```python
def function_name(formal_parameter0, formal_parameter1):
  return None

# Actual parameter also known as argument
function_name(actual_parameter0, actual_parameter1)
```

What happen when a function get invoked,

1. Bind actual parameter(s) and formal parameter(s)
2. Move *point of execution* to body of function
3. Execute function body until end or `return` (with newly created stack frame/symbol table, this scope called static/lexical scope)
4. Invocation value is the returned value(stack frame goes away/popped off the top stack after function completes)
5. Transfer back the *point of execution*

*Function name* is binding to the procedure object in python.

*Static/lexical* scoping can always be determined by looking at the program. Blackbox abstraction separates the details of how we do the computation from the use of the computation.

**Decomposition**, create structure, break a problem into modules that are self-contained and reusable.

**Abstraction**(many-to-one process), function provide abstraction (capture computation and treat as if primitive). Internal details are hidden (a.k.a. blackbox). It preserve relevant information in given context and forget irrelevant information. The **key of abstraction** is to find notion of relevance which is appropriate for both builder and client(True art).ext.

For parameter binding, Python supports *positional*, *keyword arguments* (used conjunction with default value, see below).

```Python
def function_name(formal_parameter0, formal_parameter1 = DEFAULT_VALUE):
  return None
```

```python
# object `x` bound to name in function
# it is treated as local to that function
def f(x): # <- `x` is local to `f` function
  def g():
    x = 'abc'
    print 'x:', x
  def h():
    z = x
    print 'z:', z
  x = x + 1
  print 'x:', x
  h()
  g()
  print 'x:', x
  return g

x = 3
z = f(x)
print 'x:', x
print 'z:', z
z()
```

**Test function** is important which saves tremendous amount of time while developing.

[*docstring*](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/#specification) provides specifications of functions and can be accessed using the build-in `help`.

```python
# Google Style docstring
def function_with_docstring(arg):
    """function functionality description

    Args:
      arg (str): string argument sample input

    Returns:
      bool: True, False otherwise
    """
    return 1990

def findRoot(x, power, epsilon):
  """Assumes x and epsilon int or float,
    power an int, epsilon > 0 & power >= 1
    Returns float y such that y**power is within epsilon of x.
    If such a float does not exist,
    it returns None"""
  # Your code goes here
```

A **function specification** defines a contract between the function implementer and clients (users of a function). Two parts in the contact,

1. Assumptions, conditions must be met by clients
2. Guarantees, conditions must be met by the function

**Modules in Python**

A *module* is a `*.py` individual file containing Python definitions and statements. Each *module* has its private symbol table (environment).

```
# XYMath.py
pi = 3.141592653
```

Using `import` as a Namespace, however, `from XXXX import *` works like copy-paste.

```
# app.py
import XYMath
print XYMath.pi # -> 3.141592653
```

```
# app0.py
from XYMath import *
print pi # -> 3.141592653
```

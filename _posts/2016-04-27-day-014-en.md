Today's goals are,

- Be able to write expressions that operate on primitive data including numbers, strings, images and booleans
- Be able to write constant and function definitions
- Be able to write out the step-by-step evaluation of simple expressions including function calls
- Be able to use the stepper to automatically step through the evaluation of an expression
- Be able to use the [Dr Racket](http://racket-lang.org/download/) help desk to discover new primitives

Beginning Student Language (BSL), a specially designed programming language.

The glossary for this course can be found at [here](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:UBCx+SPD1x+1T2016/d192723b104b4c8093aa0c0fc117e97f/) (The link may not be valid at the time you click it, but it should be valid till 2018).

To form an Expression,

```lisp
(<primitive> <expression> ...)
```

One sample expression of adding two numbers,

```lisp
(+ 1 1)
```

Use `;` to comment out code. `(sqr TargetNum)` to find the square of `TargetNum` and `(sqrt TargetNum)` to find the square root of `TargetNum`.

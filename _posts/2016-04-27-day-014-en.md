New course! [How to Code: Systematic Program Design - Part 1](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:UBCx+SPD1x+2T2016/courseware/d4b5b9454a3e47689c866b557162d73d/348790b506ce479789ffd6c227d1bc9d/)

Today's goals are,

- Be able to write expressions that operate on primitive data including numbers, strings, images and booleans
- Be able to write constant and function definitions
- Be able to write out the step-by-step evaluation of simple expressions including function calls
- Be able to use the stepper to automatically step through the evaluation of an expression
- Be able to use the [Dr Racket](http://racket-lang.org/download/) help desk to discover new primitives

Beginning Student Language (BSL), a specially designed programming language.

The glossary for this course can be found at [here](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:UBCx+SPD1x+1T2016/d192723b104b4c8093aa0c0fc117e97f/) (The link may not be valid at the time you click it, but it should be valid till 2018).

To form an Expression,

```lisp
(<primitive> <expression> ...)
```

One sample expression of adding two numbers,

```lisp
(+ 1 1)
```

Use `;` to comment out code. `(sqr TargetNum)` to find the square of `TargetNum` and `(sqrt TargetNum)` to find the square root of `TargetNum`.

```lisp
;; Call to primitive
  (+ 2 (* 3 4) (- (+ 1 2) 3))
;; |       |          |
;; |       |          |
;;operator |          |
;;      operands    operands
```

The rule to evaluate a primitve call (The intuitively, left to right and inside to outside),

1. First reduce operands to values
2. Then apply primitive to the values

One string example, "This is a string example". We can concate two strings using,

```lisp
(string-append "Ada" " " "Lovelace")
```

USing `string-length` to get the length of a string and using `substring` to get substring from a string using 0 base indexing, `(substring "ABC" 1 2)` which return `"B""`.

More calls to primitives dealing with images,

`require` is like import in other programming languages,

```lisp
(require 2htdp/image)
```

Few examples of using `2htdp/image`,

```lisp
(circle 10 "solid" "red")
(rectangle 30 60 "outlien" "blue")
(text "hello" 24 "orange")

;; overlay above beside are some common operator
(beside (circle 10 "solid" "red")
	    (circle 10 "solid" "red")
		(circle 10 "solid" "red"))
```

How to define constant definition (Once the constant is define it cannot be changed, it can be used in other places in program),

```lisp
(define <name> <expression>)
```

Name can be a sequence of characters including `A..Z`, `a..z`, `0..9` and `!@$%^&*_+?<>` (Beginning Student Language).

One example below,

```lisp
(define WIDTH 300)
(define HEIGHT 600)

(* WIDTH HEIGHT) ;; -> 240000
```

The evluation rules for constant definitions are,

- to evaluate a constant definition, evaluate the expression and record the resulting value as the value of the constant with the given name
- to evaluate a defined constant name, the value is the recorded value

Function is powerful and use a function making the code more concise; If the function is named well, it gives the code more meaning as well.

> Functions are pretty central to the whole game.

Below is one function example,

```lisp
(define (functionName parameter)
  (circle 40 "solid" parameter))
```

To form a function definition (The function skeleton),

```lisp
(define (<function_name> <parameter_name> ...)
  <expression_body>)
```

To form a function call expression,

```lisp
(<name_of_defined_function> <expression> ...)
```

To evaluate function call,

1. first reduce operands to values (called the arguments)
2. replace function call by body of function in which every occurence of parameters are replaced by corresponding argument

True/False question for computation is the fundamental. Boolean is the answer for True/False question in computer.

```lisp
;; true
;; flase

(define WIDTH 100)
(define HEIGHT 100)

(> WIDTH HEIGHT)  ;; -> false
(>= WIDTH HEIGHT) ;; -> true
(= WIDth HEIGHT)  ;; -> true
```

To form an if expression,

```lisp
(if <expression_much_produce_boolean>
    <expression_true_answer>
	<expression_false_answer>)
```

```lisp
(if (> 1 2)
    "True"
	"False")
;; -> False
```

So the rule to evaluate an if expressions are,

1. if the question expression is not a value evaluate it, and replace with value
2. if the question is true replace entire if expression with true answer expression
3. if the question is false replace entire if expression with the false answer expression
4. the question is a value other than true or false so produce an error

Three more logical expression `and`, `or` and `not` expression (All expressions must produce Boolean value in BSL),

```lisp
(and <expression1> <expression2> ...)
(or <expression1> <expression2> ...)
(not <expression>)
```

Using Stepper (The button on the left of Run button) to see each execution step of a primitive call.


**How to find more information you need?**

1. Make luck guess! (It become more and more accurate when you have more experience)
1. Search and scorll/quick in-text search (Ususally depends on the auto-complete features)

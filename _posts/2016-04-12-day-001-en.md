# Course Objectives

- become good at making computer do what you want
- Learn computational thinking
- Master the art of computational problem solving

Computer does **two** things,

- Stores data (Huge storage space)
- Computes data (Fast process speed)
  - Calculate built in primitives
  - Creating designed methods of calculating

Computational mode of thinking means that everything can be viewed as a math problem involving numbers and formulas.

Two types knowledge,

- Declarative (i.e., the desired result is specified), statement of facts (The square root of $$x$$ is a number $$y$$, that $$y^2 = x$$)
- Imperative/Procedural (i.e., sequence of operation to perform), "how to" methods or recipes (Such as [methods of computing square root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_computing_square_roots))

The detailed comparison between two types of knowledge can be found at [Does Procedural Knowledge Start as Declarative Knowledge](http://lrs.ed.uiuc.edu/students/sbarnett/edpsy399/declarative.html). Computer Science most interested in Declarative Knowledge because *algorithms are recipes*.

Two types computer,

- Fixed Program Computers, are designed to do very specific things (e.g. calculator).
- Stored Program Computers (e.g. modern computers), store and manipulate instructions and then interpreter execute instructions in order. Instructions are built from predefined primitive instructions
  - Arithmetic and logic
  - Simple tests
  - Moving data

Interpreter executes instructions and uses test to change flow of control through sequence, to stop when done by change the value of Program Counter inside Control Unit.

*Basic Machine Architecture*

- Memory, stores instruction and the computed result(s)
- Arithmetic Logic Unit, compute arithmetic computation
- Control Unit, control flow of execution

*How Computer Works*

1. Store a set of instructions inside memory
2. Initialize a counter inside Control Unit and point to the first instruction inside memory
3. Execute the instruction in Arithmetic Logic Unit and store the result back to memory
4. Increment the counter by `1` and point to the next instruction inside memory until all instructions are executed

Running test can change the value of counter, hence, change the flow of control.

[Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing) showed that using six primitives can compute anything, also known as [Turing Completeness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness) which means anything computable in one language is computable in any other programming language.

Modern computers have more than six primitives and have ability to create new "primitive" (function/method).

Each programming language provides,

- A set of primitive operations
- Mechanisms for combining primitives to form complex legal expressions
- Mechanisms for deducing meanings/values associated with computations/expressions

Programming languages define syntax and semantics needed to translate computational ideas into mechanical steps. Interactive with computer always roughly the same.

Aspects of [Programming Languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language)

- Set of Primitive Constructs, literals such as number, string, [operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_(mathematics))
- Syntax (Syntax error)
- Static semantics, which syntactically valid string have a meaning (Static semantics error, `10/'2'`)
- Semantics, There is [one and only one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniqueness_quantification) meaning associated with one particular statement (Meaning may not be what was intended, which can be prevented by practicing defensive programming) which can be prevented by practicing defensive programming, such as crashes, infinite loop and wrong answer)

The goal of learning a programming language is,

- Learn the syntax and semantics
- Learn how to use syntax and semantics to translate "recipes" for solving a problem using computer
- Solve problem(s) using computational thinking

Computational mode of thinking means that everything can be viewed as a math problem involving numbers and formulas.

Two types knowledges,

- Declarative (i.e., the desired result is specified), statement of facts ("the square root of $$x$$ is a number $$y$$, that $$y \times y = x$$, usually not what we need for computational thinking)
- Imperative (i.e., sequence of operation to perform), method on how you reached to that fact. (Such as [methods of computing square root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_computing_square_roots))

Computer does **two** things and two things only,

- Stores data
- Computes data.

Computer has two types,

- Fixed, is designed to do very specific things(e.g. calculator).
- Stored, stores and manipulate instructions(e.g. modern computers) and then interpreter execute instructions in order.
  - Instructions are built from predefined primitive instructions
    - Arithmetic and logic
    - Simple tests
    - Moving data
  - Interpreter executes instructions
    - Use test to change flow of control

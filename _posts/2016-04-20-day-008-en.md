## Assertions and Exceptions

*Exception* (Build-in Exception Details [here](https://docs.python.org/2/library/exceptions.html)) is an unexpected condition. What to do when there is an exception,

- Fail silent (BAD)
- Return an 'Error' value (`-1` was return in early days; Extra checking code for other function)
- Stop execution, signal error condition (`raise Exception("Error Information")`)

Python code can provide handler for exception, but handler usually is only meant to deal with one particular type of exception.

```python
try:
  f = open('filename.txt')
except IOerror e:
  # Exception propagation
  # Raise the exception to caller (See explanation below)
  raise Exception("Cannot open file")
```

Common error types are,

- `SyntaxError`
- `NameError`, local/global name not found
- `AttributeError`, attribute reference fails
- `TypeError`, operand does not have correct type `'a' + 3`
- `ValueError`, operand type okay, but value is illegal `int('$')`
- `IOError`, IO system reports malfunction (file not found)

User-defined Exceptions

```python
class NetworkError(RuntimeError):
  def __init__(self, arg):
    self.args = arg

try:
  raise NetworkError("Bad hostname")
except NetworkError, e:
  print e.args
```

Catch all exceptions,

```python
try:
  # Your code here
except:
  # Catch *all* exceptions
```

The extension to `try`,

- `else`, executed when no exception
- `finally`, always get executed (useful for clean up)

```python
def divide(x, y):
  try:
    result = x / y
  except ZeroDivisionError e:
    print str(e)
  except TypeError e:
    print str(e)
  except ValueError, Argument:
    print Argument
  else:
    # If there is NO exception
    print result
  finally:
    # Always get executed
    print "Finally Clause"
```

In Python, [`raise`](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions) has two usage (See discussion [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13957829/how-to-use-raise-keyword-in-python)),

- Raising errors when the function unable to produce a result consistent with specification, `raise [Exception [, args [, traceback]]]`
- Re-raise the exception in an exception handler, so that it can be handled further up the call stack

```python
def function_name(arg):
  if arg < 1:
    #      Exception    Argument
    #         |           |
    raise "Invalid Arg", arg

try:
  function_name(0)
except "Invalid Arg", Argument
  print Argument # -> 0
else:
  print "Done"
```

**Asssertions**, `assert Expression[, Arguments]`, can be used to ensure the assumptions on state of computation are as expected (sanity-check). If it does NOT meet the assumption, `AssertionError` will be raised which can be handled by `try-except` statement. (a.k.a Denfensive Programming)

```python
def avg(grades, weights):
  # Raise AssertionException when list is empty
  assert not len(grades) == 0, 'No grades data'
  # Python list comprehension
  new_grade = [convertLetterGrade(elt) for elt in grades]
  return dotProduct(new_grade, weights) / len(new_grade)
```

Use assertion for *Defensive Programming*, checks pre- and post-conditions on input and output, avoid propagating bad value(s).

Common usage of `assert` are,

- Checking types/values of arguments
- Checking that invariants on data structures are met
- Checking constraints on return values
- Checking for violations of constraints on procedure

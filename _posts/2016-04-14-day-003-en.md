[Branching structure](http://www.cs.utah.edu/~germain/PPS/Topics/branching.html) in [Day 002]({% post_url 2016-04-13-day-002-en %}) enable program jumps to different pieces of code base on test in constant time.

[Loop structure](http://www.cs.utah.edu/~germain/PPS/Topics/loops.html) enable program repeat pieces of code until a condition is met (Running-time depends on number of iteration and length of program), which can be use to create more complex algorithms (ex. Guess and check).

Loop characteristics (`for` and `while` statements),

- Loop variable (Initialize variable, change variable, test), the variable also known as "state variable"
- Useful to think about a *decrementing function* to ensure code termination (Optional)

Read more about [`for` loop](http://www.cs.utah.edu/~germain/PPS/Topics/for_loops.html) and [`while` loop](http://www.cs.utah.edu/~germain/PPS/Topics/while_loops.html) in pseudocode.

Code below use `while` loop to convert decimal value in to binary,

```python
is num < 0:
  isNeg = True
  num = abs(num)
else:
  isNeg = False
result = ''
if num == 0:
  result = '0'
while num > 0:
  result = str(num % 2) + result # <- get the binary digit
  num /= 2 # <- shift to right
if isNeg:
  result = '-' + result
```

Computer represents numbers in binary.

*Floating number representation*

```
# Convert decimal fraction into binary floating representation
3/8 = 0.375 = 3*10*(-1) + 2*10**(-2) + 5*10*(-3)
# (1) Convert fractional into integer
0.375 * (2**3) = 3 (decimal)

# (2) Convert decimal into binary
3 -> 11

# (3) Divide by 2**3 (shift left)
0.011 (binary)
```

`num` used below is a finite decimal number.

```python
# Refer conversion steps above
p = 0
while ((2**p)*num)%1 != 0: # (1) Convert fractional into whole num
  p += 1
print "p:", p
num = int(num*(2**p))
result = ''
if num == 0:
  result = '0'
while num > 0: # (2) Convert decimal into binary
  result = str(num%2) + result
  num /= 2
for i in range(p - len(result)): # (3) Division, shift left
  result = '0' + result
result = result[0:-p] + '.' + result[-p:]
print str(num), 'Binary Representation', result
```

If there is NO integer `p` such that `x*(2**p)` is a whole number, then internal representation is always an approximation

Fractional number is an estimation, therefore, NEVER use `==` when comparing two floating numbers instead `target_a - target_b < 0.00001` should be used.

Introducing [Bisection Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisection_method)(Searching continuous function values)/[Binary Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm)(Searching a finite sorted array), reducing the range in each stage dramatically which means algorithm is important.

[Trial and error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_and_error) (Guess and check) is based on loop construct and guess can be generated using,

- [Brute-force Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_search) (Exhaustive search or generate and test)
- Bisection search
- [Newton-Raphson (Newton's methods)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method), a general approximation algorithm to find roots for polynomial in one variable.
